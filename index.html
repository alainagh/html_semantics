      a distinct species. </p>

  <h2>More Information</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Diet</dt>
    <dd>More than half of a bonobo's diet is made up of fruit and leaves. However, they also eat things besides plant
      matter such as honey and meat from small animals. </dd>
    <dt>Habitat</dt>
    <dd>Bonobos live in humid forests. They are found south of the Congo River.</dd>
    <dt>Characteristics</dt>
    <dd>These apes are sensitive and compassionate creatures. However, they get more cross with age. They are social,
      sexual creatures. Instead of males leaving their groups as in the case of wolf packs and lion prides, bonobo
      females will leave instead. This is what mixes the ape gene pools.</dd>

    <!-- Gotta insert that disclaimer, you know? I actually had no idea that Bonobos were mostly known for these tendencies when I started writing up the website and by the time I found out, it was too late. Hopefully this makes up for it, haha. -->
    <h3>A Quick Note</h3>
    <p>Please note that while these apes are sometimes looked at with only their carnal tendencies, they are much more
      than that and deserve to be represented in a respectful way.</p>
